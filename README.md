# Adversarial-Search-Mancala-Game

The task of this assignment is to implement a game player which uses adversarial search algorithms
to play a two player game. The game we shall consider here is Mancala.
The implementation was included a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. I also needed
to
● Experiment with different search strategies (e.g., iterative deepening search).
● Experiment by varying depth-limits and changing move-ordering.
Moreover, I needed to implement various heuristics and find out which one is better by running
experiments.
